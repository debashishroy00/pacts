Now waits for actual App Launcher button to appear,\nwhich only loads after full authentication.\n\nChanges:\n- Wait for URL change to SF domain\n- Then wait for App Launcher button selector\n- Shows ''Still waiting...'' message during 2FA step\n- Only closes browser after Lightning UI fully loads\n\nThis ensures browser stays open through entire 2FA flow.\")",
